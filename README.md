This web mapping application allows you to create interactive maps to visualize your own data set on the web. Due to its lightweight thin-client architecture, all data is processed in the browser.
The main functionalities of the web application include:
- Search for a geographic location
- CSV file upload
- Customize the size of circular map markers

See live demo [here](https://mairamorenoc.github.io/WebMAppViz/)

**Please, notice:**
- This application only supports files in **.csv** (comma-separated-values) format
- Your file must contain columns with **latitude and longitude coordinates** and at least **one variable to visualize**. Please check the "data" folder and use the demo data set as a reference.
